# Instructions:
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts.
# 2. Select your project and create a new service account or use an existing one.
# 3. Grant necessary roles (e.g., Google Sheets Editor, Google Drive Editor) to the service account.
# 4. Create a key for the service account (JSON format) and download the file.
# 5. Open the downloaded JSON file.
# 6. Copy the entire content of the JSON file.
# 7. Paste the content into the Streamlit Secrets editor under the `[google_credentials]` section, ensuring it's valid TOML.
#    Alternatively, you can copy each value from the JSON file to the corresponding field above.
#    Make sure the private_key is enclosed in triple quotes ("""...""") or uses escaped newlines (\n).
# 8. Save the secrets in Streamlit Cloud settings.
